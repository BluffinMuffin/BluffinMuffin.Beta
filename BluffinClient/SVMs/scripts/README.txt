SVM FILES
---------
SVM files have been generated with svm_light (http://svmlight.joachims.org/), because
 it is faster and stronger, but it is in C++. So, what we have manually converted
 resulting files into a LIBSVM format.
 
We made a little script to help us, but it uses GnuWin32 programs. The file can
 be found in the folder "scripts" to see what are the differences between the two formats.
